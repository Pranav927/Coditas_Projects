# Coditas Projects Repository

## Welcome

Hi, I'm Pranav. Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository. This is a curated collection of four projects specifically developed to showcase my technical capabilities and understanding of real-world business challenges that align with Coditas's expertise and values.

## Why Coditas

After researching Coditas extensively, I discovered a company that truly resonates with my vision of technology as a force for meaningful change. What draws me to Coditas isn't just the opportunity to learn and earn, but the chance to contribute to projects that make a genuine difference in healthcare, financial services, and enterprise solutions. Your work with organizations like Mayo Clinic and IDFC First Bank demonstrates the kind of impact-driven development I want to be part of.

I'm particularly inspired by Coditas's commitment to clean coding practices, exceptional user experiences, and the company's impressive 50% year-on-year growth with a team of 700+ engineers. This speaks to a culture of excellence and innovation where I can contribute meaningfully while growing as a developer.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains four carefully selected projects that demonstrate different aspects of my technical skills and business understanding:

### 1. Django CRM Project
**Foundation Project - Python & Django Mastery**

This project represents my entry into web development with Django and showcases my understanding of fundamental web application principles. Built as a Customer Relationship Management system, it demonstrates:

- Clean Django architecture and MVT pattern implementation
- MySQL database integration with proper ORM usage
- User authentication and session management
- CRUD operations with form handling and validation
- Responsive Bootstrap interface design

While simple in scope, this project laid the foundation for my Django expertise and taught me the importance of building scalable, maintainable code from the ground up.

### 2. Healthcare Chat Multiple PDF
**AI-Powered Medical Research Tool**

This healthcare document intelligence system addresses a critical challenge in medical practice - the endless research doctors must conduct during emergencies and complex cases. The project features:

- Multi-PDF document processing capabilities
- AI-powered query responses using Ollama LLM (cost-free operation)
- Integration with PubMed's 35+ million medical citations
- BioBERT embeddings for medical domain accuracy
- HIPAA-compliant local processing for privacy protection
- Clean, medical-grade user interface

This project demonstrates my ability to work with cutting-edge AI technologies while understanding the critical importance of privacy and compliance in healthcare applications.

### 3. Inventory Management System
**Enterprise-Grade Business Solution**

Building upon the learnings from my Django CRM project, this comprehensive inventory management system represents a significant step toward e-commerce and enterprise solutions. Key features include:

- Advanced customer relationship management with business classifications
- Complete product catalog with SKU and category management
- Supplier relationship and purchase order systems
- Real-time stock tracking with automated alerts
- Multi-warehouse location support
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboard
- Order management for both sales and purchases

This project showcases my growth as a developer and my understanding of complex business processes that require robust, scalable solutions.

### 4. Value Addition Project - Intelligent Banking Advisor 2.0
**Innovation Through Strategic Thinking**

This project holds special significance as it builds upon Coditas's previous work with IDFC First Bank's holographic avatar project. After researching this collaboration, I identified opportunities for substantial improvement and cost optimization:

**The Challenge**: IDFC's original holographic avatar cost 50L+ per branch with 10L+ annual maintenance, yet provided only static, pre-scripted responses limited to business hours and specific locations.

**My Solution**: An intelligent financial advisory system that delivers:
- 100x cost reduction through cloud-native architecture and free Ollama LLM
- 24/7 availability across web, mobile, and API platforms
- Real-time market data integration with NSE/BSE feeds
- Personalized investment advice and risk assessment
- Dynamic financial intelligence replacing static responses

This project demonstrates not just technical skills, but strategic thinking and the ability to identify business value opportunities. It shows my research into Coditas's portfolio and my desire to contribute meaningfully to existing client relationships.

## Technical Growth Journey

These four projects represent my evolution as a developer:

1. **Foundation**: Starting with basic Django concepts and database operations
2. **Innovation**: Incorporating AI and machine learning for real-world applications
3. **Complexity**: Building enterprise-grade systems with multiple integrated components
4. **Strategic Value**: Identifying and solving business challenges through technology

## Development Philosophy

Throughout these projects, I've focused on:
- **Clean, maintainable code** that follows best practices
- **User-centered design** that prioritizes experience and accessibility
- **Business value creation** through technology solutions
- **Continuous learning** and adaptation of new technologies
- **Privacy and security** as fundamental requirements, not afterthoughts

## Future Vision

I see these projects as just the beginning. At Coditas, I'm excited about the opportunity to:
- Work on healthcare solutions that can save lives through better technology
- Contribute to financial services innovations that democratize access to wealth management
- Learn from experienced teams while bringing fresh perspectives to challenging problems
- Build solutions that scale globally and impact millions of users

## Invitation for Feedback

I would be more than happy to receive your suggestions on how I can further develop this repository and contribute more value to the Coditas ecosystem. Each project here represents not just code, but a commitment to solving real problems through thoughtful technology.

Thank you for considering my work. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how these projects and my passion for meaningful development can contribute to Coditas's continued success.
